## How does it work

It uses Apache with PHP, PHP PDO with MySQL, and Redis.

I save the PHP, HTML and javascript in the same file, such as `sample.php`:

```php
<?php
echo "hi";
?>
<html>
123456789
</html>
<script>
console.log("HIIIIIIIIIIII");
</script>
```

### MySQL

Users and teams's documents.

### Redis

Save the review records.

### Other

I only love LAMP+REDIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I only love codes not English!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## How to install it

Go to the releases page.

### Windows

Will support in a short time.

Don't rush me. Don't I want to update?

### Linux

Please make sure you haven't installed Apache before. If you want to reinstall it, please run 'uninstall.sh' before installing again.

### macOS

If you give me an Apple computer, I will support macOS.

### Not Linux

If you can install PHP, Apache2, MySQL, and Redis on your operating system, you can edit 'install.sh' and let me know!

### Other

If you find some mistakes, please tell me, or you can send me the right code! (~~I won't tell you I am lazy~~
